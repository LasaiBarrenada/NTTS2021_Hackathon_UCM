# NTTS2021_Hackathon_UCM
 Dashboard developed for the NTTS 2021 Hackathon by @LasaiBarrenada Rodrigo Gonzalez and Victor Perez from Univeristy Complutense of Madrid. The application was presented to the European Commission on 05/03/2021 on the NTTS Hackathon pitching session. 
 
 To display the dashboard you can use the sample.csv file and run the app.R script. The data used in the sample is from COMEXT Monthly of 2019 and 2020 but it could be modified downloading custom data from the bulk download https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?sort=1&dir=comext%2FCOMEXT_DATA%2FPRODUCTS and running the FilterScript.R.
